For this challenge you need to create a simple SELECT statement that will return all columns from the people table, and join to the sales table so that you can return the COUNT of all sales and RANK each person by their sale_count.
people table schema

    id
    name

sales table schema

    id
    people_id
    sale
    price

You should return all people fields as well as the sale count as "sale_count" and the rank as "sale_rank".

-- Create your SELECT statement here

SELECT people.id, people.name,
  COUNT(sales.id) AS sale_count,
  RANK () OVER (ORDER BY count(sales.id)) AS sale_rank
FROM people
JOIN sales
ON people.id = people_id
GROUP BY
  people.id;
