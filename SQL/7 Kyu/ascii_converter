Given a demographics table in the following format:

** demographics table schema **

    id
    name
    birthday
    race

you need to return the same table where all text fields (name & race) are changed to the ascii code of their first byte.

e.g. Verlie = 86 Warren = 87 Horace = 72 Tracy = 84

/*  SQL  */
SELECT id, ASCII(LEFT(name, 1)) AS name, birthday, ASCII(LEFT(race, 1)) AS race
FROM demographics;
